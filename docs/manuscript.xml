		1 On a DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS. 1
		A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely.
		Noticeable. ORANGE...YELLOW...as we realise...Itís FIRE...
		A SOUND. Something SHATTERING...
		Then. A DISEMBODIED VOICE. Muted. We canít quite make out
		What itís saying. As it gets LOUDER. And LOUDER. When we
		finally. Understand...

		2 INT. SPOONERíS APARTMENT - CLOSE ON 2
		DEL SPOONERíS FACE. His eyes, snapping open. His face,
		covered in sweat.
		PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed. Sheets, tangled around
		his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly
		cheerful.
		Spooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT
		ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a
		couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream.
		You are in danger...
		He rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His
		apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of
		someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy.

		4 INT. BATHROOM - MORNING 4
		Shaves with a razor. Using his left hand. Knicks the cleft
		of his chin. Shit.

		5 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 5
		Stares down at the single egg in a saucepan. Waiting for it
